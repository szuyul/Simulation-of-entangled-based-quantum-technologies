# Simulation-of-entangled-based-quantum-technologies

This folder contains few separate scripts for different quantum techniques:
1. quantum_key_distribution.py simulates optical communication using classical light source or quantum entangled source and compares security under eavesdropping.
2. quantum_entangled_source_SPDC.py simulates the generation of entangled photon pair from nonlinear optical crystal (spontaneous parametric down conversion).
